      Each class will last <b>3 full hours</b>. It will accept <b>up to 10
      learners</b> and will be run by at least 2 higher-level wizards.<br><br>
      <u>For each meetup</u> we will try to prepare short screencasts and other materials with different assignments.<br>
      <u>First meeting</u> is going to be informal and will include helping learners get set up with Linux and getting started with some of the basics.
      The "formal" class part will begin the second week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hack-and-tell days will also be organised and wizards will be able to share what they are working on there. This will be easy going events where learners will be able to get some feedback and to inspire those who want to join wizard amigos.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all who want to do more there will also be homework so learners will be able to practice their spells.
      We also encourage all the participants to have some project they want to work on.<br>
      <i>(but if they don't, no worries, will help them find one).</i>
