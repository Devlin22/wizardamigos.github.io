# Wizard Amigos online JavaScript school
[wizardamigos.com](http://wizardamigos.com/)

Our program is **online** and for **free**. We have also encourage local meetups, where learners can meet with other learners and more experience developers 2x a week (see [Coding Amigos] (http://www.codingamigos.com)), but they can 24/7 access [support chat] (https://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners), integrated into the page.

* The program can be started by people who never touched a computer. It starts explaining and exercising typing, making an email account, explaining a browser, searching on google and many other basics.
* After that there is a long phase teaching the basics of the javascript programming language and all its constructs (loops, if/else, variables, functions, objects, and so on...)
* Once that is established, learners build their own portfolio homepage and pull their profile information from github (could also be facebook or twitter or something else)
* After that, they build their first web application (a quiz that can be answered by many users and in the end shows a chart that compares ones own answers with that of others)
* In the end they create a mobile iPhone app from that quiz web application.
* In the future we plan to also teach how to make standalone desktop apps and realtime multiuser apps
